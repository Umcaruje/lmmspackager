lmmspackager
============

This program packages LMMS projects and the used samples in a zip archive
for easier sharing.

Requirements:
* Python 3.3 or later

Known bugs:
* Because I have no access to Windows, I don't have any idea how this works
  there. Feel free to fork and fix.

TODO:
* Support for sample tracks
* Support for samples outside LMMS working directory
